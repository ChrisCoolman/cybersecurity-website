        <h1>About Thanksgiving</h1>
        <p>Thanksgiving is a national holiday celebrated in the United States and Canada. It is a time for family and friends to gather and give thanks for the harvest and the blessings of the past year.</p>
        <p>The holiday has its origins in the early 17th century when English Pilgrims and Native Americans shared a harvest feast in 1621. This event is often regarded as one of the first Thanksgiving celebrations in the colonies.</p>
        <p>Today, Thanksgiving is celebrated with a traditional meal that typically includes turkey, stuffing, and pumpkin pie. It is also a time for reflection, gratitude, and spending time with loved ones.</p>
